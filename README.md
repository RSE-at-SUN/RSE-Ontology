This project aims to map the relationships between skills, services and technologies within the domain of Research Software Engineering (RSE). 

This project is driven by the growing need for RSEs by researchers, as research is becoming increasingly reliant on computational technologies, and there is a growing emphasis on providing reusable, reproducible data which increasingly necessitates software engineering skills that are not posessed by most researchers. 

By creating a semantic overview of the interaction between skills, technologies and services in the RSE community, this ontology will be able to provide information on the skills and technologies that each RSE has familiarity with, and the services that they are able to provide to researchers, to facilitate the assignment of skillsed RSEs to projects where they will be able to provide software development and software-development-related assistance.

This project was started with the main goal in mind being to assist in solving management-related problems that RSE teams may be facing. This project also hopes to provide a concise semantic representation of the RSE community, which may have broader applicability in terms of identifying skills gaps and opportunities for skills exchanges. Lastly, we hope that this project will help to raise awareness of what RSEs do, and the value they bring to the research ecosystem.


_A project that developed out of the Hons Informatics work of Megan Stock, Nina and Rhone Roux, and Ariana Subroyen at Stellenbosch University, in collaboration with [RSE@SUN](https://rse.sun.ac.za/) and which is continuing under the [Open Life Science (OLS)](https://openlifesci.org/ols-6) training and mentoring programme._
